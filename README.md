# macos-docklocker
Simple set of scripts to lock/unlock the Dock in macOS

 1. `lock.sh`:
	 1. Allows locking the Dock's position, size and contents.
	 2. This script will make it so that the user cannot change the Dock's position in the System Preferences, nor it's size and it's contents cannot be modified either.
2. `unlock.sh`:
	1. Allows unlocking the Dock's position, size and contents.
	2. This script will make it so that the user will be able to change the Dock's position in the System Preferences, as well as it's size and it's contents.

You can use these scripts to (for example) prevent accidental changes.
You can also comment out one or more commands, if you don't want to (un)lock some settings of the Dock.
